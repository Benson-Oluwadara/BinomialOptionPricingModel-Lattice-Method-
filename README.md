Binomial Option Pricing Model is a widely used financial model for calculating the value of an option, which is a derivative security that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price and time.

This implementation uses the lattice method to calculate the value of an option at each node of a binomial tree, where each node represents a possible price of the underlying asset at a particular time. The algorithm then recursively moves up the tree, calculating the option value at each node based on the option values at the nodes below it, until it reaches the top of the tree, which represents the option value at the current time.

The implementation is written in Python and includes a class called BinomialOptionPricingModel that takes in parameters such as the current price of the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of the underlying asset. It then generates a binomial tree and calculates the option value using the lattice method.

The implementation also includes methods for calculating the delta and gamma of the option, which are measures of its sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset price and volatility, respectively.

This implementation can be useful for anyone interested in understanding how the binomial option pricing model works and for anyone who wants to use it to price options or analyze option strategies.
